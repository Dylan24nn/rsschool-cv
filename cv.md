I want to tell you about my priorities and sides in IT which can help me to give benefits to company and my aims. Speaking about my strong sides I want to tell about my three best habits which helped me in my path.

Creativity gives me a light and bring a spark on projects and problems in a new way. To see the best in every tricky thing or a situation. One side can be not evident as another. We don't have a best solution or resolution but we have variety of them and it is the matter of a situation which will be more suitable and open to new possibilities. 

Keen on learning new material because I thing it is the most interesting thing to give a life to something new. Only new material, skills can bring you new instruments, knowledge and a vision to solve and figure out new challenges.

Discipline is always making me as an realiable person who always knew about his tasks and deadlines, someone who can measure it's own responsibility.
